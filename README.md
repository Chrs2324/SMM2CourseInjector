# SMM2CourseInjector

An application that allows you to automatically add SMM2 courses to your save file! To get started, simply create a new course and save it onto the course bot. Then, create a folder titled "smm2 courses" and place it in "sdmc:/switch". Next, add your downloaded courses to the folder. Once you've placed your courses in the folder, simply run the application and it will inject the courses into your save file!
